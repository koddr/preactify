# ✨ Reactless.ts

A handy production-ready template for **rapidly** frontend development that you've often dreamed of. 

Included awesome [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) framework with TypeScript, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) visual frameworks, and configured next generation frontend tooling called [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). 

🔥 Yep, with **full backward compatibility** to all of [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) ecosystem, but without its overhead! 🔥

## ⚡️ Quick Start

Make sure that the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed. Version `12.x` and higher is required.

For easily template installation process (_without `git clone` and other things_), please install `degit` tool:

```bash
npm install -g degit
```

Next, let's download `Reactless.ts` template:

```bash
degit koddr/reactless-ts my-app
```

And, finally, go to your app folder, install dependencies and run dev server:

```bash
cd ./my-app && npm install && npm run dev
```

## 🏗 Build for production

For create a production build, just run `npm run build` command.

## 🤔 Why such a strange name? 

This template was created in pursuit of **reducing size** of the bundle, but with a great desire to make backward compatibility with React. Therefore, the name denotes the direction of the author's movement to **reduce the presence of React.js** in the template. Less React, less bundle size! That's it.
