# ✨ Reactless.ts

A production-ready template for **rapidly** frontend development. Included [Preact.js](https://preactjs.com/) TypeScript, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/), next generation frontend tooling called [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). 

🔥 Yep, it's **full backward compatibility** with React, but without React overhead! 🔥

## ⚡️ Quick Start

Make sure that the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed. Version `12.x` and higher is required.

For easily, install template (_without `git clone` and other things_), install `degit` tool:

```bash
npm install -g degit
```

Next, let's download `Reactless.ts` template:

```bash
degit koddr/reactless-ts my-app
```

And, finally, go to your app folder, install dependencies and run dev server:

```bash
cd ./my-app && npm install && npm run dev
```

## 🏗 Build for production

For create a production build, just run `npm run build` command.
